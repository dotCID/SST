# SST
Code written for the TU Delft course Smart Systems Technology exercises and tutorials.


## Contents
This folder contains a number of *.ino files written for the above course as learning material. They are created to work with an Arduino Uno R3 or similar board and a SparkFun ESP8266 Shield. These two devices can connect to the ThingWorx server of the TU Delft in order to up- or download data from it.
Also included are PDF files accompanying the code with detailed explanations of the parts and how to create the appropriate ThingWorx Things, Properties and Mashups.

###Usage
To use these files, copy the contents of the files into your Arduino window, change the values marked with "TODO:" where necessary and upload them to the Arduino.
Downloading the Sparkfun ESP8266 libraries is needed to be able to run this code. They can be found at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-wifi-shield-hookup-guide .
