# SST
Code written for the TU Delft course Smart Systems Technology exercises and tutorials.


## Contents
This folder contains a number of *.cpp files written for the above course as learning material. They are created to work with an Arduino Uno R3 or similar board and a SparkFun ESP8266 Shield. These two devices can connect to the ThingWorx server of the TU Delft in order to up- or download data from it.

###Usage
To use these files, copy the contents of the files into your Arduino window, change the values marked with "TODO:" where necessary and upload them to the Arduino.
